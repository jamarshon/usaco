Palindromes are numbers that read the same forwards as backwards. The number 12321 is a 
typical palindrome.

Given a number base B (2 <= B <= 20 base 10), print all the integers N (1 <= N <= 300 base 10) 
such that the square of N is palindromic when expressed in base B; also print the value of that 
palindromic square. Use the letters 'A', 'B', and so on to represent the digits 10, 11, and so on.

Print both the number and its square in base B.
